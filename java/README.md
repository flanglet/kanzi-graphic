Build Kanzi
===========

The only library dependency is kanzi.jar (https://github.com/flanglet/kanzi).

To build the library, run the command 'ant'.

Run 'ant build_lib' to generate a JAR file with all classes in tree excluding tests.

Look at the test package to see what filters/samplings/color model transforms can be performed.

The generated kanzi-graphic.jar file is under 'target'.
